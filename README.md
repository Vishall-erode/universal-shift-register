# universal-shift-register
A Universal Shift Register is a sequential logic circuit that combines the capabilities of multiple types of shift registers. It can shift data left or right, hold data, or load data in parallel, making it an essential component in many digital systems.

Key Operations:
Parallel Load: Loads data into the register simultaneously.
Shift Left: Shifts data bits to the left, with new data entering from the right.
Shift Right: Shifts data bits to the right, with new data entering from the left.
Hold: Retains the current data state without changes.
Features
Configurable Width: Supports n-bit configurations.
Multi-Mode Operation: Parallel load, shift left, shift right, and hold functionalities.
Simulation Support: Includes a comprehensive testbench for functional verification.
Parameterizable Design: Easily modify bit-width and control inputs.
